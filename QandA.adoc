== Working through Question 21
to find the number in each decimal place I could use the formula

----
 floor(mod(num / 10 ^place); 10)
----

but I also need to find the numbers width
for that I could use the formula

----
 round(log(10; num) + 1)
----

or

----
 count the number of times I can divide by 10 before reaching zero
----

make sure to use unsigned math to floor output maybe?
might try this without tail call optimization first

in this case I think I need to perform my own modulo
dang forgot an easy way to get remander from a division problem

math for creating modulo

----
 a / b = c
 round(c) * b = d
 a - d = answer
----

I can look through C's https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/stdlib.h/itoa[itoa] source code and try something similar.


== Q and A

A19::
    r13 is not cleared before it is used and could return junk values

Q21::
    Try to rewrite `print_int` without calling `printf_uint` or copying its
    code: Hint read about tail call optimization
